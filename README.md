# Flag Guesser

This is my first practical (basic) android application, took me 10 hours⌛

## Overview
📍The app provides a set of images of country flags🚩along with multiple choices, and the user is expected to guess the right country name from the image✅  
📍The correct answer is shown after submitting their choice, and the final result is shown at the end of the quiz📃  
📍The set of images of country flags and country names is retreived from a public API endpoint provided by [FlagCDN](https://flagcdn.com) 🌟
